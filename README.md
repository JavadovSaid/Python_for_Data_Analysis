## Data Preparation and Cleanup

This section outlines the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and usability.

---

### Import & Clean Up Data

I begin by importing the necessary libraries and loading the dataset, followed by essential cleaning tasks to improve data quality and consistency.

#### Code Snippet

```python
# Importing Libraries
import ast
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from datasets import load_dataset
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  

# Loading Data
dataset = load_dataset('lukebarousse/data_jobs')
df = dataset['train'].to_pandas()

# Data Cleanup
df['job_posted_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['job_posted_date'])
df['job_skills'] = df['job_skills'].apply(lambda x: ast.literal_eval(x) if pd.notna(x) else x)
```
---

### Filter US Jobs
To focus the analysis on the U.S. job market, I apply a filter to include only roles based in the United States.

```python
  df_US = df[df['job_country'] == 'United States']
```
---
## The Analysis

Each Jupyter notebook in this project focuses on a specific question about the data job market. Here's how I approached each one:

---

### 1. What are the most in-demand skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?

To identify the top skills for the most common data roles:

- I filtered the dataset to find the **top 3 most frequent job titles**.
- Then, I calculated the **top 5 skills** associated with each of these roles.
- This analysis helps pinpoint the most essential skills to focus on based on your target role.

**View the full notebook** for this analysis: [2_Skills_Count.ipynb](2_Project/2_Skills_Count.ipynb)

---

### Visualizing the Data

The following code snippet creates horizontal bar charts to show the **top 5 skills** for each of the top 3 roles:

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(job_titles), 1)

for i, job_title in enumerate(job_titles):
    df_plot = df_skills_perc[df_skills_perc['job_title_short'] == job_title].head(5)[::-1]
    sns.barplot(
        data=df_plot, 
        x='skill_percent', 
        y='job_skills', 
        ax=ax[i], 
        hue='skill_count', 
        palette='dark:b_r'
    )

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## 3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?
To identify the highest-paying roles and skills, I only got jobs in the United States and looked at their median salary. But first I looked at the salary distributions of common data jobs like Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and Data Analyst, to get an idea of which jobs are paid the most.

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [4_Salary_Analysis_.ipynb](2_Project/4_Salary_Analysis.ipynb)
### Visualization

```python
sns.boxplot(data=df_US_top6, x='salary_year_avg', y='job_title_short', order=job_order)

ticks_x = plt.FuncFormatter(lambda y, pos: f'${int(y/1000)}K')
plt.gca().xaxis.set_major_formatter(ticks_x)
plt.show()
```

### Results

### Insights
- There's a significant variation in salary ranges across different job titles. Senior Data Scientist positions tend to have the highest salary potential, with up to $600K, indicating the high value placed on advanced data skills and experience in the industry.

- Senior Data Engineer and Senior Data Scientist roles show a considerable number of outliers on the higher end of the salary spectrum, suggesting that exceptional skills or circumstances can lead to high pay in these roles. In contrast, Data Analyst roles demonstrate more consistency in salary, with fewer outliers.

- The median salaries increase with the seniority and specialization of the roles. Senior roles (Senior Data Scientist, Senior Data Engineer) not only have higher median salaries but also larger differences in typical salaries, reflecting greater variance in compensation as responsibilities increase.

## Highest Paid & Most Demanded Skills for Data Analysts
Next, I narrowed my analysis and focused only on data analyst roles. I looked at the highest-paid skills and the most in-demand skills. I used two bar charts to showcase these.

### Visualize Data
```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 1)  

# Top 10 Highest Paid Skills for Data Analysts
sns.barplot(data=df_DA_top_pay, x='median', y=df_DA_top_pay.index, hue='median', ax=ax[0], palette='dark:b_r')

# Top 10 Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analystsr')
sns.barplot(data=df_DA_skills, x='median', y=df_DA_skills.index, hue='median', ax=ax[1], palette='light:b')

plt.show()
```
### Results
Here's the breakdown of the highest-paid & most in-demand skills for data analysts in the US:
